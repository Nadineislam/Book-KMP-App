# ðŸ§  Libraries and Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Ktor : Used for making network requests to fetch book data from the REST API. Provides a lightweight and asynchronous HTTP client for smooth and efficient data communication.

ðŸ”¹ Koin : A lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin, used to manage dependencies across ViewModels, repositories, and data sources.

ðŸ”¹ Room Database : Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for managing local data storage. Used to persist favorite books and retrieve them offline.

ðŸ”¹ Jetpack Compose : Modern declarative UI toolkit for building reactive and maintainable Android interfaces.

ðŸ”¹ Navigation (Compose Navigation) : Used for seamless navigation between screens â€” from the list of books to their detailed views.

ðŸ”¹ Coroutines : Handles asynchronous operations like network calls and database interactions, ensuring smooth and responsive UI updates.

ðŸ”¹ Clean Architecture : Implements a clear separation of concerns with data, domain, and presentation layers, promoting scalability and testability.

ðŸ”¹ MVI (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Intent) : Ensures a unidirectional data flow where the UI renders based on a single immutable state, making state management predictable and robust.
